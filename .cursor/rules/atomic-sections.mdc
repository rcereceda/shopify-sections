# Atomic Sections Standards

## Comments

**Always use Liquid comments instead of HTML comments** for documentation headers and internal notes.

### ✅ GOOD - Liquid Comments

```liquid
{%- comment -%}
  Atomic Sections
  https://atomicsections.com
  License: MIT
  
  Hero Banner Section
  
  A full-width hero section with image or video background.
  
  Features:
  - Image or video background
  - Customizable overlay
  - Flexible content positioning
{%- endcomment -%}

<div class="hero-section">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

### ❌ BAD - HTML Comments

```liquid
<!-- 
  Atomic Sections
  https://atomicsections.com
  License: MIT
  
  Hero Banner Section
-->

<div class="hero-section">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

### Why Liquid Comments?

1. **Not rendered in HTML**: Liquid comments don't appear in the final HTML, reducing page size
2. **Better performance**: Less bytes transferred to the browser
3. **Cleaner output**: No unnecessary comments in production HTML
4. **Shopify best practice**: Recommended approach for Liquid theme documentation

### When to use HTML comments

Only use HTML comments (`<!-- -->`) when:
- You need the comment visible in browser source for debugging
- You're adding temporary notes during development that should be removed before production
